## Features

- Insert, search, delete records by username
- Linear probing for collision resolution
- Save/load hash table to/from file
- Advanced: operations by phone number
- Calculate search length

## Build and Run

g++ -Iinclude src/*.cpp -o hashtable
```

Run:

```
./hashtable
```

## Test

Compile test:

```
g++ -Iinclude src/*.cpp test/test_cases.cpp -o test_hash
```

Run test:

```
./test_hash
```
